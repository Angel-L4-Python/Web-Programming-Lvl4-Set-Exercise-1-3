            <p>Photographer Adam Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) and oncologist Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) regain consciousness while chained to pipes at either end of a filthy bathroom. As the two men realize they've been trapped by a sadistic serial killer nicknamed "Jigsaw" and must complete his perverse puzzle to live, flashbacks relate the fates of his previous victims. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and young daughter (Makenzie Vega) are forced to watch his torture via closed-circuit video.

                <b>"I wasn't expecting this!"</b> <br>
                <i><b>EVON1TY12 October 2022</b></i> <br>
                I watched some of the next movies before this. I wasn't expecting this one can be this good!
                
                There was some minor flaws in it but the story was really good overall with it's effective twist and all. Amazing editing, scores and sound by the way.
                
                I believe this is not just an ordinary horror movie, it's also a really great crime movie.
                
                Even if the movie wasn't that good at most, the ending would save it, the ending is so perfect with that "Hello Zepp" score. That music makes the scene two times better. 
                
                If I had to mention the minor flaws, here is one example. I don't know why the car parking and all the other areas so dark and feels abandoned? I know, It's because this is a horror movie and the movie tries to scare you. But it's a bit much actually.

                <i><b>jack_o_hasanov_imdb14 August 2021</b></i><br>
                One of the best movies I've watched. I didn't get any spoilers while watching this movie and the ending was devastating.<br>
                
                The tension was perfect and you are looking forward to the end. <br>
                
                Soundtrack is one of the best. I always watch it, even if the series gets worse as it goes. <br>

                I accidentally stumbled onto this one when I googled how to make a wooden pencil box. I wasn't disappointed

                <b>"BRILLIANT"</b> <br>
                <i><b>hfreinoso23 October 2018</b></i> <br>
                I love this movie man. I just love everything about it. Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere from start to end, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that ENDING. Man I LOVE that ending. With unknown actors and they all did and incredible job acting in these types of situations. This film was, in my opinion, exciting, thrilling, and an overall entertaining film to watch. It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. This was an enormous achievement for both James Wan, and Leigh Wannell. The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary cliches. The film is incredible and it start from Saw 2,3,4,5,6, Final Chapter, Jigsaw, and now in 2020 Spiral. I don't care what anyone says Saw is the best of the series and the best horror movie ever. 10/10. Love it.

                <b>"I loved it"</b> <br>
                <i><b>dhruvdude10 February 2005</b></i> <br>
                Movies like Saw are the ones that makes us believe in the horror genre. It is because of such movies we like to see horror/thriller movies. Let me tell you that after watching Saw I wanted to buy the ticket and watch it again because after a long time I got to see a real gripping and tightly directed horror movie. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat. I just can't wait for the DVD to come out as I really want to buy it. My recommendation to all of you is to watch Saw and have a good time like I did. Also, the movie has a great twist. 10/10
